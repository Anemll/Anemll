# ANEMLL

ANEMLL (pronounced like "animal") is an open-source project focused on accelerating the porting of Large Language Models (LLMs) to tensor processors, starting with the Apple Neural Engine (ANE).

## 🚀 Version 0.3.3 Alpha Release - Initial Support for QWEN 3 & QWEN 2.5 Architecture

### 🆕 **New Features**
- **QWEN 3 Architecture Support**: Added support for Qwen3-0.6B and Qwen3-4B models with custom converter optimizations
- **QWEN 2.5 Architecture Support**: Added support for Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct and other Qwen 2.5 variants
- **Streamlined Installation**: One-command setup with automatic virtual environment detection
- **Automated Testing Framework**: End-to-end validation scripts for conversion and inference workflows
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Improved error handling, better feedback, and simplified testing

### 📦 **Quick Start (New Simplified Workflow)**
```bash
# 1. Setup environment (one-time)
./create_python39_env.sh

# 2. Install dependencies (auto-detects virtual environment)
./install_dependencies.sh

# 3. Test conversion pipeline
python tests/test_qwen_model.py     # Test Qwen 3 models
python tests/test_qwen2.5_model.py  # Test Qwen 2.5 models
python tests/test_llama_model.py    # Test LLaMA models

# 4. Convert your own models
./anemll/utils/convert_model.sh --model <path> --output <dir>
```

## Goals
> The goal is to provide a fully open-source pipeline from model conversion to inference for common LLM architectures running on ANE.
> This enables seamless integration and on-device inference for low-power applications on edge devices, ensuring maximum privacy and security.
> This is critical for autonomous applications, where models run directly on the device without requiring an internet connection.
>
> We aim to:
> - Provide flexible and easy to use library/framework to port LLMs to ANE directly from Hugging Face models
> - Provide on-device examples for iOS and macOS swift or C/C++ Applications

See update [Roadmap.md](./docs/Roadmap.md) for more details

### Pre-converted Models

We provide sample converted models ready for use:
- **LLAMA 3.1/3.2** (1B and B variants) including iOS "friendly builds"
- **🆕 Qwen 3** (0.6B and 4B) - **New in 0.3.3!** Initial support with custom converter
- **🆕 Qwen 2.5** (0.5B-Instruct) - **New in 0.3.3!** Initial support with custom converter
- **DeepSeek** distilled models
- **DeepHermes** distilled models

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that Quantization should be improved. LUT4 quality is fairly low due to lack of Block Quantization on Apple Neural Engine.

### 🧪 **New Testing Infrastructure**

#### Quick Model Testing
- **Generic HF Model Testing**: `./tests/conv/test_hf_model.sh [model_name] [output_dir] [chunks]`
- **LLaMA Testing**: `python tests/test_llama_model.py`
- **Qwen 3 Testing**: `python tests/test_qwen_model.py`
- **Qwen 2.5 Testing**: `python tests/test_qwen2.5_model.py`

#### Test Any HuggingFace Model
```bash
# Test any model with automatic naming
./tests/conv/test_hf_model.sh meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct

# Test with custom output directory
./tests/conv/test_hf_model.sh Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct /tmp/my-test

# Test larger models with chunks
./tests/conv/test_hf_model.sh meta-llama/Llama-3.2-8B-Instruct /tmp/llama8b 4
```

#### Features
- **Auto-downloads models**: No manual setup required, downloads models from HuggingFace
- **Fast validation**: Uses unquantized FP16 conversion for quick pipeline testing
- **Virtual environment aware**: Automatically activates env-anemll if present
- **End-to-end validation**: Tests cover conversion → Python inference → Swift CLI inference
- **Clean testing**: Uses `/tmp` directories to avoid cluttering your workspace
- **HuggingFace Authentication**: Automatically uses your HF token for gated models
> Some GPTQ and Spin Quant should greatly improve LUT4 models.

## Swift CLI Reference Implementation

The Swift CLI provides a reference implementation for running models on Apple Neural Engine. For detailed documentation, see [Swift CLI Guide](./docs/swift_cli.md).

### Quick Start

1. Download a model from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/anemll)
2. Convert the model using our single-shot conversion script:
```bash
./anemll/utils/convert_model.sh --model <path_to_model> --output <output_directory>
```
3. Run the model using our sample code:
```bash
python ./tests/chat.py --meta <output_directory>/meta.yaml
```

For detailed conversion steps and advanced options, see:
- [Model Conversion Guide](./docs/convert.md)
- [Single-shot Conversion Script](./docs/convert_model.md)
- [DeepSeek Model Guide](./docs/ConvertingDeepSeek.md)

## Testing with Python

We provide two chat interfaces:
- `chat.py` - Basic chat interface for quick testing
- `chat_full.py` - Advanced chat with conversation history management

Features of chat_full.py:
- Maintains full conversation history within context window
- Automatically truncates older messages when needed
- Shifts context window dynamically during long responses
- Shows generation speed and token statistics
- Better handles multi-turn conversations

### Quick Testing with Conversion Scripts

```bash
# Test complete pipeline: download → convert → inference
./tests/conv/test_qwen_simple.sh    # Tests Qwen3-0.6B conversion
./tests/conv/test_llama_simple.sh   # Tests meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B (requires HF access)
```

> **📝 Note:** Test scripts use small models (0.6B-1B parameters) with unquantized FP16 conversion for faster testing and validation. For production models with quantization (LUT4/LUT6), use the full conversion script with your preferred model size.

### Manual Chat Testing

```bash
# Basic chat
python ./tests/chat.py --meta ./converted_models/meta.yaml

# Full conversation mode
python ./tests/chat_full.py --meta ./converted_models/meta.yaml
```
See [chat.md](./docs/chat.md) for more details 

> [Note]
>The first time the model loads, macOS will take some time to place it on the device. Subsequent loads will be instantaneous. Use Ctrl-D to exit, Ctrl-C to interrupt inference.




## Installation

### System Requirements
- **macOS Sequoia** with Apple Neural Engine (Apple Silicon recommended)
- **Minimum 16GB RAM** (32GB recommended for 8B models)
- **Python 3.9-3.11** (Python 3.9 strongly recommended for best compatibility)
- **Xcode Command Line Tools** (for CoreML compiler)
- Dependencies: coremltools>=8.2, transformers>=4.36.0, numpy>=1.24.0, scikit-learn<=1.5.1

### 📦 Installation (New Streamlined Process)

**🚀 One-Command Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Create Python environment with correct version (auto-detects Python 3.9/3.10/3.11)
./create_python39_env.sh

# 2. Install all dependencies (auto-detects and activates virtual environment)
./install_dependencies.sh

# 3. Verify installation with automated tests (downloads models automatically)
./tests/conv/test_qwen_simple.sh    # Test Qwen conversion (auto-downloads ~2.4GB)
./tests/conv/test_llama_simple.sh   # Test LLaMA conversion (auto-downloads ~500MB)
```

**🔧 Manual Setup (if needed):**
```bash
# Create virtual environment with Python 3.9 (recommended)
python3.9 -m venv env-anemll
source env-anemll/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
./install_dependencies.sh
```

> **📝 Note on Test Scripts:** The automated test scripts will automatically download required models from HuggingFace:
> - `test_qwen_simple.sh` downloads `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` (2.4GB) - tiny model, unquantized FP16
> - `test_llama_simple.sh` downloads `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-135M` (500MB) - tiny model, unquantized FP16
> 
> **First run may take longer due to model downloads. Models are cached for subsequent runs.**
> These use small models with no quantization for fast validation - ideal for testing the pipeline.
> 
> **Alternative: Test with your own models:**
> ```bash
> # Convert any HuggingFace model
> ./anemll/utils/convert_model.sh --model <your_model_path> --output /tmp/test-model
> python3 tests/chat.py --meta /tmp/test-model/meta.yaml --prompt "Hello!"
> ```

### ✅ **Verification Steps**

The installation script automatically verifies:
- ✅ Python version compatibility (3.9-3.11 supported, 3.9 recommended)
- ✅ Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install` if missing)
- ✅ CoreML compiler (`xcrun --find coremlcompiler`)
- ✅ PyTorch with MPS support
- ✅ CoreML Tools compatibility
- ✅ Apple Neural Engine availability

**Manual verification commands:**
```bash
# Check CoreML compiler
xcrun --find coremlcompiler

# Verify Python environment
python --version  # Should show 3.9.x - 3.11.x
pip list | grep -E "(torch|coremltools|transformers)"

# Test Apple Neural Engine
python -c "import torch; print('MPS available:', torch.backends.mps.is_available())"
```
